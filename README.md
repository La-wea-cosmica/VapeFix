# How To Use It?
1 Join to the server you wanna cheat on

2 Run the script/exe

3 Inject vape

4 Thats it!

# How It Works??
It just change your date time to october 2 of 2022 if you dont get it watch this [Haiers Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_73HshPvmA) he shows what this script does but without the script
(ngl i made just cuz i dont wanna be changing my date every single time)

## Advantages
  * Fps On Gui gets Fixed (No More 5/6 fps on gui)
  * RShift Glitch gets Fixed (No More Keybinds set to RShift)

## Disadvantages
  * Some programs may not work by the date change (in my case spotify and my browser dont work)
  * You need to be in a server before running the fix or you will not join to any server until your date come back to normal
  * If you Switch to another server you will need to press enter on the script and when it closes join to the server u want then run the script again
  * ^^^ By Doing this all your keybinds will be changed to RShift and the TextGui will be Glitchy/Broken (so remember your keybinds say goodbye to the TextGui)
# Is It Worth It??
if you are gonna cheat on 1 single server and you dont care about some programs dont working like spotify ill say yessir
